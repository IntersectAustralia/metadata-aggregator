## About ##
The Metadata Aggregator provides an institution-wide approach to metadata about research data collections. This project is designed to gather, manage, and publish metadata about research data collections and other related entities, resulting in collection discovery and reuse.

Within scope for the Metadata Aggregator is the establishment of a mechanism via which willing researchers can publish and advertise their research data collections in RDA, for discovery and re-use by the wider global research community. In addition, upgrades to the existing University research data store will be carried out, to provide infrastructure and software enabling:

  1. Researcher defined access permissions to research data, without being bound by institution specific credential  requirements.
  1. A web interface to upload and download research data
  1. A structured and ordered platform for storing research data
  1. A mechanism for researchers to advertise research data sets in RDA, and make the research data directly accessible from RDA.

The Metadata Aggregator was built by [Intersect](http://www.intersect.org.au) for the [University of Sydney](http://www.sydney.edu.au)
